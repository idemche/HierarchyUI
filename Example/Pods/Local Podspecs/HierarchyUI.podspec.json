  "description": "SwiftUI is a declarative UI layouting framework.\nHierarchyUI is a declarative Navigation construction framework.\n\nAs Apple states in its official documentation:\nSwiftUI uses a declarative syntax, so you can simply state what your user interface should do.\nFor example, you can write that you want a list of items consisting of text fields,\nthen describe alignment, font, and color for each field.\nYour code is simpler and easier to read than ever before, saving you time and maintenance.\n\nSwiftUI's implementation implies that Navigation is embedded into UI layout, within NavigationLink.\nThat creates some limitation in terms of different architectures which tend to separate UI from business\nand navigation logic.\n\nHierarchyUI provides a way to create a readable and simple way to create a declarative Navigation structure\nseparately, without mixing it with UI.",
